  \frametitle{Who am I\dots}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item not really a software developer\\
    \dots but write code sometimes
  \item developing embedded systems for 25 years
  \item VME, CompactPCI, AdvancedTCA, SoM
  \item FPGA and SoC-FPGA (Altera/Intel, Microsemi/Microchip)
  \item VHDL (RTL-code, no, it is not a software)
  \end{itemize}

  My usual problem with the software is how to make it run on a
  hardware which is known not to be working yet and how to bring-up
  and test this hardware. With a soft-core CPU it is getting even
  worse.
